ðŸŒŠ Predicting Sea Level Rise by 2050 ðŸŒŠ

Overview:
In this project, I utilized historical sea level data to predict future sea level rise by the year 2050. Using linear regression analysis, I modeled the trend of sea level rise over time and extrapolated this trend to make predictions for the future.

Methods:
I began by collecting and preprocessing a dataset containing historical sea level measurements from reliable sources. Next, I applied linear regression techniques to the data, fitting a regression line to capture the relationship between time and sea level rise. By analyzing the slope and intercept of the regression line, I quantified the rate of sea level rise and made projections for future sea levels.

Insights:
Through this analysis, I gained insights into the accelerating trend of sea level rise and its potential implications for coastal communities and ecosystems. The results highlighted the urgency of addressing climate change and implementing measures to mitigate its impacts on sea levels.

Implications:
The predicted sea level rise by 2050 has significant implications for coastal regions worldwide, including increased risks of flooding, erosion, and loss of habitat. It underscores the importance of proactive measures to adapt to rising sea levels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate further climate change.

conclusion:
we are destroying the planet
